                        <div class="p">At Rivian I got to work on the 2022 R1T, R1S, and Amazon EDV. As a design release engineering intern, I had the oppurtunity 
                            to work on both system validation and component validation on the R1 program. The components I spent the most attention on 
                            were the wireless charging pad within the vehicle and the intrusion detection module. The intrusion detection module uses 
                            ultrasonic waves to detect break-ins and works seamlessly with the car's Gear Guard protection system in order to alert 
                            the owner of the vehicle. I worked with international suppliers in order to calibrate and integrate the intrusion modules 
                            into the vehicle and test for false-positives and false-negatives with the system. The wireless charging pad is a multicoil design, 
                            meant to charge a multiple devices on a flat surface. Due to the emergence of MagSafe technology from Apple, multicoil designs have become obselete.

                        <div class="p">The wireless charging pad is a multicoil design, meant to charge a multiple devices on a flat surface. Due to the emergence of 
                            MagSafe technology from Apple, multicoil designs have become obselete. The magnets utilized in the MagSafe design disrupt the magnetic field 
                            of the wireless charger and initiates a current protection state for the wireless charger. This phenomenon is known as foreign object detection 
                            and is desired. However, the newer iPhones will force the charger into the state even though a foreign object is not present. In an effort to solve this 
                            issue, multiple solutions were proposed and validated including: changing the coil layout, introducing dividers for the charger, and increasing the friction 
                            between the phone and the pad.

                        <div class="p">The Psyche mission is a journey to a unique metal-rich asteroid orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. 
                            What makes the asteroid Psyche unique is that it appears to be the exposed nickel-iron core of an early planet, one 
                            of the building blocks of our solar system. Deep within rocky, terrestrial planets - including Earth - scientists 
                            infer the presence of metallic cores, but these lie unreachably far below the planets' rocky mantles and crusts. 
                            Because we cannot see or measure Earth's core directly, Psyche offers a unique window into the violent history of 
                            collisions and accretion that created terrestrial planets. The mission is led by Arizona State University. NASA's 
                            Jet Propulsion Laboratory is responsible for mission management, operations and navigation. The spacecraft's 
                            solar-electric propulsion chassis will be built by Maxar (formerly SSL) with a payload that includes an imager, 
                            magnetometer, and a gamma-ray spectrometer.

                            around Jupiter in order to perform a detailed investigation of Europa -- a world that shows strong evidence 
                            for an ocean of liquid water beneath its icy crust and which could host conditions favorable for life. The 
                            mission will send a highly capable, radiation-tolerant spacecraft into a long, looping orbit around Jupiter 
                            to perform repeated close flybys of the icy moon.

                            The Advanced Mission Program consists of proprietary ground data-centers and a constellation of classified satellites. At this stage in the program, the spacecraft 
                            and ground control systems have not yet been built and were still in the software simulation stages. I developed training scenarios that allowed test engineers to train 
                            mission control operators on faults that may occur in the system. I drafted the system-level requirements for validation of datapath flow and communications between mission 
                            management and the various simulations. Utilizing Python and the Robot Framework, I developed an automated test script that allowed the software engineers to validate their 
                            simulator's functions.

                            he priority of this project was to emulate FPGA bitfile loading into the simulator. Each FPGA had to be activated and deactivated individually in order 
                            to ensure that no data is lost. Additionally, if a spacecraft were to be damaged or lose communications, the ground control system must be able to autonomously communicate with 
                            the other satellites active in the constellation. In order to accomplish this, the ground control stations must conrol their slew angle and direct themselves 
                            to an available spacecraft immediately. During this process, multiple parameters were collected and validated including: power usage, slew rate, and data throughput.

                        My internship at L3 IEC consisted of circuit testing on navigational equipment including GPS and guidance systems. Additionally, I learned about the fundamentals 
                        of digital signal processing and taught an ECE-101 to my fellow interns. Most importantly, I redesigned the employee auditing system. Before, the government project 
                        timesheets were filled out and logged by hand. I utilized Microsoft Excel and VBA in order to automate the process and reduce the amount of time needed to calculate 
                        said hours. This script also determined the amount of time spent within each building of the facility, and led to more accountability within the workplace regarding 
                        secure compartmentalized information.
