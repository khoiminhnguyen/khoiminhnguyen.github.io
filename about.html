                        Hi, my name is Khoi Nguyen. I am an electrical and computer engineering student at Cal Poly Pomona, graduating in Spring 2023. I grew up in a small 
                        Vietnamese enclave called Little Saigon. Financially, I did not grow up with many resources, but I was so fortunate to 
                        have parents and teachers who supported my educational career throughout every stage of my life. My family was poor, but it never felt like 
                        it. My parents invested what little resources they had into books and other studying tools for my siblings and I. By the time I was in elementary 
                        school, I qualified for an advanced learning track, the Gifted and Talented Education Program. The district changed my designated schools, and I 
                        took classes that shaped my dreams. Despite being a Title 1 school, I had access to computer science, physics, and engineering classes. My teachers 
                        put in the time to take us to industry talks and to coding competitions. At the time I did not know how key these moments were for my future, but I now 
                        credit these teachers for my success today. They inspired me to become an engineer and I've never thought of any profession outside of engineering. I 
                        regularly return to my high school to speak about my path to becoming an engineer and try to mentor them towards their dreams
                    </div>                   
                    <div class="col-lg-6">
                        <div class="h1">Where I'm Going</div>
                        The automotive industry and space industry are the two fields that I have the most passion for. Something is so special about seeing a car you helped design 
                        driving down the street, or seeing your spacecraft launching on a rocket. After graduation I hope to experience this feeling more because there is nothing like it. 
                        For the past two years, I've been juggling school, projects, and work and focusing on improving myself both personally and career-wise. Life for me has always been 
                        about living up to my own potential and everyday is another chance to step up to the plate. Outside of engineering, I hope to follow in my teachers' and professors' 
                        footsteps and give back to the community by sharing my knowledge and experience with the next generation of students and engineers. I want to instill the same passion for 
                        engineering that I have into the next generation. I dream of becoming an engineer and contributing to the next wave of ground-breaking innovation. However, my biggest dream 
                        is to inspire kids the same way that my teachers inspired me.
